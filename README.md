# React [Redux / Tanstack Query / Mock Service Worker] JavaScript Starter/Boilerplate

## Overview

This project is built using **React 18.3.1** and leverages several popular JavaScript libraries and tools to create a
modern, fast, and scalable front-end application. The project uses **Vite** as its build tool for optimized development
and production builds.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** ~ v23.x.x
- **NPM** ~ v10.x.x

## Features

- **React & Redux** for state management and UI rendering.
- **React Router DOM** for routing.
- **Axios** for HTTP requests.
- **React Query** integration for server state management.
- **Eslint** and **Prettier** for maintaining code quality and style consistency.
- **SASS Embedded** for advanced styling capabilities.
- Mocking with **MSW** (Mock Service Worker).
- **Husky** for Git hook management.
- **Knip** for dependency analysis and dead code detection.
- **Vitest** for testing and test-driven development.
- **Plop.js** for component and file scaffolding.

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

This project utilizes **Plop.js** to scaffold components. To create a new component, run:

```bash
npm run generate
```

Follow the prompts to auto-generate boilerplate files for the React components:

1. Navigate to the desired directory using the terminal.

2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run generate
   ```

3. You will be prompted to provide the following inputs:

   - **Component Name**: Enter the name of your new React component, for example.: `Header`

4. Once the inputs are provided, Plop will generate the boilerplate files for your component in the appropriate
   directory under `components/ComponentName/`.

5. Review the generated files and customize them as needed.

This ensures quick creation of React components that follow the project's coding standards and directory structure.

### Linting and Formatting

Run the linting script to check for code issues:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Prettier is configured to auto-format code on save using your IDE. Ensure that your development setup supports Prettier
auto-formatting.

### Running Tests

Use **Vitest** to run tests for your components or business logic:

- Run all tests:

  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

- Run the Vitest UI for an interactive testing experience:

  ```bash
  npm run test:ui
  ```

### Dependency Analysis with Knip.js

Run Knip.js to check for unused dependencies or dead code in the project. This helps to keep the codebase lean and
clean:

```bash
npm run scan:deadcode
```

### Mocking Data with MSW

This project uses **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** to mock API endpoints during development and testing. MSW ensures
controlled responses and prevents dependency on actual backend services.
See the `src/views/HomeExample/mocks/postsMock.js` as an example.

```bash
npm run dev:mock
```

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
2. Ensure all changes are tested, formatted, and do not introduce linting errors.
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes.
